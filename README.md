# Koda Designs

## Overview

### Background
My wife and I began freelancing as a design/dev shop in early 2023. This is a landing page for our business. It is designed to showcase our style, our work, and our interests. We named the business after our dog [Koda](https://www.instagram.com/aussieboi_koda/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y%3D).

## Our process

### Built with

- Next.js
- Figma
- Tailwind
- Headless WordPress

### What I learned

I made this in January 2023. It was my first time using Tailwind and only my second time using Next.js. It was also my first time using the WordPress Rest API. If I were to rebuild this knowing what I know now, I probably wouldn't choose Next. In fact, I wouldn't use a framework at all.
